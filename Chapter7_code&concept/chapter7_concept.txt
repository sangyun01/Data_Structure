Ch7.1 -> General Trees(nonlinear Data Structure)
tree are hierarchical(계층 구조) -> above and below
not parent has one child -> more child element
top == root -> (root is most of parent)
external -> no child / internal -> has one or more children

So tree STL consist of iterator
p.parent() -> parent of p node
p.children() -> children of p node
p.isRoot() -> return true when the p has parent -> only occure the false when the p is root
p.isExternal() -> return the true p is leaf

Tree function
size() / empty() / root() / positions() -> using iterator
